/**
 * Design Pattern
 *
 * # What are design pattern? > Design pattern are evolved as reusable solutions
 * to the problem that we encounter while every day of programing > It s a
 * template or description for how t solve a problem that can be use in many
 * situation > Pattern choice and usage among various design pattern depend on
 * individual need and their problem > Design pattern are very powerful tool for
 * software development
 *
 * # There are 23 design pattern according a famous book "Gang of Four"
 *
 * # Type of design pattern 1. Creation Design Pattern 2. Structural Design
 * Pattern 3. Behavior Design Pattern
 *
 * # Creation Design Pattern > This is type design pattern deals with the object
 * creation and initialization > This pattern gives the program more flexibility
 * in deciding which object need to created for which class 1. Singleton 2.
 * Factory 3. Abstract Factory
 *
 * # Structural design pattern > This pattern focuses on decoupling interface
 * and implementation class and its object 1. Adapter 2. Bridge 3. Composite etc
 *
 * # Behavior design pattern > This type of pattern deal with the communicaton
 * between classes and object 1. chain of responsibility 2. Interceptor 3.
 * Observer ect
 *
 * # Singleton Design Pattern > This pattern belong to creation desing pattern >
 * This pattern is used when we need to make sure that only one object of a
 * particular class need to be created > All further references to the object
 * are refere to the same object
 *
 * > Change the consutructor access modifier from public to private make it
 * impossible for any one to create object > we can use property or method to
 * create common shared instance of a class > we can use final keywor to make
 * our class impossible for inheritance
 *
 * # Advantage > Singleton control the concurrent access to the resource > It
 * ensure there is only one object accross application in the control state
